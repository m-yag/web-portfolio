Nearly two weeks since the initial commit. While I'm no complete stranger to web-design, using Vue has been an eye-opener 
(and here I thought I could go pro just for knowing some Bootstrap). As happy as I am with the progress I've made, there's 
still a ways to go.

#### Journal Component

The journal component is finally functional, albeit a far cry from the type of elegant code I initially had in mind. In 
theory, there would be a single vue file per project which would import all markdown journal entries associated with that 
project and, in turn, pass those entries to the 'Journal' component. Hence to add a journal entry to a project, one would 
simply need to write a markdown file and ensure it was placed in the correct directory. Instead, the way it actually works 
involves editing 2 separate files and modifying 2 others. It's a 2 minute job at worst, but there are far too many moving 
parts for my taste.

That said, now that I've got a working component, I'm hitting the pause button on all journal-related code to focus on 
other elements.

#### Semantic Versioning

I've been having some difficulties trying to figure out how to version the project as [SemVer](https://semver.org/) 
doesn't quite apply to the development of a website. I could just do away with versioning altogether, but I'd much rather 
adhere to some kind of versioning scheme as it keeps things structured (and gives me an immense sense of satisfaction 
whenever I do increment). For now, let's keep the underlying principles of SemVer and use the following, slightly 
modified, incrementing rules:

Given a version number, increment the:

- __major__ version number when overhauling the framework or applying extensive UI changes that completely change the look and 
feel of the website.

- __minor__ version number when adding new features or components.

- __patch__ number when shipping bug fixes or subtle styling/design adjustments.

Any content addition to existing components require no increment.

Going through the git log and starting with the initial commit at 0.1.0, the project's version number should currently be 
at 0.13.1. I intend to increment the major version number once the website contains the minimum number of elements 
required for publication.
