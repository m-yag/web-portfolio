# web-portfolio

_web-portfolio_ is a vue-based single page application website that I created in order to show-case and publish various 
coding projects. The code itself is made public for potential employers/recruiters, but if you see anything in particular 
that you'd like to incorporate into your own code, feel free to dig around.

To see the application in action click [here](https://yagmour.io).
